        Hot chocolate, also known as hot cocoa or drinking chocolate, is a heated drink 
        consisting of shaved or melted chocolate or cocoa powder, heated milk or water, 
        and usually a sweetener. It is often garnished with whipped cream or marshmallows. 
        Hot chocolate made with melted chocolate is sometimes called drinking chocolate, 
        characterized by less sweetness and a thicker consistency.
        <br>

The first chocolate drink is believed to have been created by the Maya around 2,500–3,000 
years ago, and a cocoa drink was an essential part of Aztec culture by 1400 AD, by which 
they referred to as xocōlātl. The drink became popular in Europe after being introduced 
from Mexico in the New World and has undergone multiple changes since then. Until the 19th 
century, hot chocolate was used medicinally to treat ailments such as liver and stomach diseases.
<br>

Hot chocolate is consumed throughout the world and comes in multiple variations, including
 the spiced chocolate para mesa of Latin America, the very thick cioccolata calda served 
 in Italy and chocolate a la taza served in Spain, and the thinner hot cocoa consumed in 
 the United States. Prepared hot chocolate can be purchased from a range of establishments, 
 including cafeterias, fast food restaurants, coffeehouses and teahouses. Powdered hot 
 chocolate mixes, which can be added to boiling water or hot milk to make the drink at home, 
 are sold at grocery stores and online.
